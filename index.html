                            <em>FAMILIARIZING THE FUTURE</em> is an interactive art installation and social conversation
                            designed to
                            reframe how humans relate to robots and artificial intelligence. In an era where automation
                            threatens to
                            deepen economic inequality and corporate control, this project challenges that dystopian
                            trajectory
                            —
                            discussing an alternative vision in which robotics become tools of collective liberation
                            rather
                            than
                            exploitation.
                        </p>

                        <p class="label"><strong>[MISSION STATEMENT]</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            This exhibit aims to humanize robotics and democratize automation by using art as a bridge
                            between
                            people
                            and machines. To transform fear of technology into curiosity, empowerment, and collective
                            ownership.
                            Our
                            goal is a cultural and emotional shift where <em>robots belong to all of us</em> — not just
                            the
                            few
                            who can
                            afford to control them.
                        </p>

                        <p class="label"><strong>[CONCEPT OVERVIEW]</strong><br></p>
                        <p>
                            The exhibit merges sculpture, robotics, and wearable art into a seamless interactive
                            environment.
                            Visitors
                            design, interact, and collaborate with robots as creative partners, dissolving the
                            boundaries
                            between art
                            object and artificial intelligence. The result is a living dialogue about identity,
                            automation,
                            and
                            what it
                            means to be human in a mechanized world.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <em>FAMILIARIZING THE FUTURE</em> reframes robots as approachable, customizable, and
                            emotional.
                            It
                            challenges
                            the fear narratives driven by monopolized tech culture and proposes a world where automation
                            can
                            redistribute
                            wealth and free humans from monotonous labor. The exhibit promotes empathy, imagination, and
                            ownership —
                            showing that when shared collectively, technology <em>could</em> serve humanity.

                            By presenting robots as approachable, customizable, and emotional, this project dismantles

                            driven by tech monopolies and disruptor culture. It imagines a future where humans and
                            machines
                            collaborate —
                            not compete — and where technological power benefits all.

                        <p>
                            The exhibit centers around the customization, interaction, and re-imagining of real robots —
                            re-styled,
                            tattooed, and adorned as living sculptures. Each robot becomes a symbol of identity,
                            individuality,
                            and
                            co-evolution.
                            <br>By merging the aesthetic language of street fashion, jewelry, tattoo culture, and
                            human
                            expression with robotic design, the project challenges the sterile, corporate look of
                            current
                            tech.
                            It asks: What happens when humans reclaim the narrative of automation using visual and
                            emotional
                            connectors? <!-- reword? -->
